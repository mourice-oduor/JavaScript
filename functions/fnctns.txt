functions are declared using two syntaxes;
function declaration => normal declaration

function expression => varriable declared and initialized with a function
Also using return keyword inside a function in which when invoked, the function stops from there.

JavaScript has two scopes â€“ global and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.
